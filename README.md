# exploreHD Controls

## Documentation

The guide in [COMPANION.md](./COMPANION.md) has been superseded by our [documentation site](https://docs.exploredeepwater.com/).

### Follow our guides on streaming an exploreHD from a raspberry pi:
- [Pi Setup](https://docs.exploredeepwater.com/guides/pi_setup.html)
- [ArduSub Companion Setup](https://docs.exploredeepwater.com/guides/ardusub_companion.html)

## Getting Started

### Connecting

To connect to the pi, we suggest using ssh with Putty. You can read our documentation on that on [Step 8: SSH into the Pi](https://docs.exploredeepwater.com/guides/pi_setup.html#step-8-ssh-into-the-pi) of our pi setup docs.

### Installing

To install, run
`./install.sh`
from the root of the repository.

### Running

If you are not on a Raspberry Pi or do not wish to install the driver into the system, you can run the UI temporarily with `./start.sh`
